# OptimusAI
The revolutionary game optimizer designed to analyze, adapt, and optimize all of a games assets, code, and music. Using different AI tools I aim to create a program that automates the whole process. I want it to be a simple press of a button that takes a game to its full potential. 

## What is the idea?
Here is the general rundown of how I want this program to function.
* 1. source code and assets of a game is uploaded to the program.
* 2. The game goes through a recursive loop in which it locates all code.
* 3. The code is converted to plain text.
* 4. OptimusAI prompts the user to describe what system it needs to be able to run on.
* 5. The plaintext code is sent to ChatGPT using its api.
* 6. ChatGPT analyzes and optimizes the code, the code is then sent back to OptimusAI.
* 7. OptimusAI saves the code to a new file tree
* 8. (This part is a work in progress so take what happens here with a grain of salt)
* 9. The Textures are optimized and if necessary can be downscaled and remade with stable diffusion.
* 10. The 3D models polygons are reduced and sent back.

So far this is all that I have thought out. I am by no means a professional programmer, and this will be a new experience so feel free to suggest commits!

## Why?
This all actually stemmed from an idea that I had, I have a certain handheld game device made in the 2000s with a 3D screen, I won't say the name of the company in case they get sue happy. But there was a Half life 1 port for this device, and it runs horrendously, this is not at fault of the developers at all just merely a way the device works. I noticed native games work way better and look better than Half life 1. So I thought of this system as a way to make any game work on any device no matter what. 

### Help would be appreciated, and a Discord will come if this gets enough support!
